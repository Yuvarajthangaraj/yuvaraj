Libraries
You certainly won’t be short of libraries at Cambridge – the collegiate University has more than 100! Libraries provide study spaces, resources and staff to help you find what you need for your studies.<br>

College libraries contain standard course texts and other related materials, as well as some specialist collections.<br>
Faculty and department libraries offer more specialised subject collections and can signpost you to subject-specific electronic resources, including journals, ebooks and databases.<br>
The main University Library (or UL) is a legal deposit library holding more than eight million books, journals and other documents ranging in age from ancient manuscripts to a vast range of electronic resources available for you to access from anywhere.<br>
To ensure you get the most from the University’s libraries, the UL and many of the College, faculty and department libraries offer practical sessions and one-to-one help. These include introductory tours, sessions to highlight the resources available for particular disciplines and information skills classes.<br>

The CamGuides pre-arrival resource will also introduce you to some of the academic, research and digital practices in which Cambridge students engage.<br>

We also run a popular conversation exchange scheme with native speakers, and conversation sessions for students to maintain their spoken ability. <br>

Our range of static and interactive resources includes books, CDs, foreign films and online programmes. In addition, the John Trim Centre houses self-study resources in more than 180 languages (including English) and a dedicated Advising Team is on hand to help.<br>

Museums and collections<br>
Cambridge has nine specialist museums and collections, all of which are open to students and the public. The fascinating exhibits range from dinosaurs to modern art, and rock samples to Rembrandt. Even if none relates directly to your course, a look at the whale skeletons, classical sculpture or even the camera used by Robert Falcon Scott at the South Pole in 1912 has to add something to your time at Cambridge!<br>

Highlights from our museums and collections include:<br>

Snow goggles used by Ernest Shackleton<br>
140 million year old fossil ferns<br>
Samurai armour complete with a moustache made of boar’s bristles<br>
Rembrandt, Titian and Monet at the Fitzwilliam Museum<br>

Facilities for worship, celebration and meditation<br>
There are religion-specific places of worship in and around Cambridge for those following the Buddhist, Christian, Hindu, Jewish, Muslim and Sikh faiths, and many Colleges have chapels and designated spaces for prayer and reflection by students of all faiths or none.<br>

A number of rooms are also made available by the University for its students, staff and authorised visitors with the primary purpose of providing a safe, clean and inclusive place for worship, celebration or meditation.<br>
